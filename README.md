# Portfolio
[Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Project](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)

This project was completed as part of the Udacity Front End Web developer nanodegree program and is loosely based off of the 
[design prototype](./design-mockup-portfolio.pdf) provided. The main purpose of this project was to design and implement a completely
responsive landing page that would work across multiple devices with specifically calling out the Google Nexus 5, Apple IPAD, and desktop
responsive requirements.

## Getting started
* Clone the repo
* Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

* Start the project

```sh
npm start
```

## Building the project

This project favors npm scripts over webpack or other technologies such as grunt and gulp due to the relative straightforward nature of 
the build process for the static file landing page. The build consists of one npm command:
```sh
npm run build
```

## Main Technologies Used

* [node-sass-chokidar](https://github.com/michaelwayman/node-sass-chokidar)
* [postcss-cli](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-cli)
* [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
